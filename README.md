# lldp-bar
lldp plugin for SwiftBar

## Requirements
* [lldpd](https://github.com/lldpd/lldpd) - After being installed, lldpd runs as a daemon. LLDP data is collected on all interfaces. lldp-bar interacts with lldpd via lldpcli.
* [SwiftBar](https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar) - SwiftBar makes it easy to schedule and run scripts right from the mac menubar.
